## 🚀 How It Works

### **Step 1: User Photo Analysis** (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
When a user uploads their photo, Gemini 2.5 Flash analyzes:
- ✅ Person's appearance (gender, age, body type, skin tone, hair)
- ✅ Current pose and position
- ✅ Background and lighting conditions
- ✅ Detailed physical characteristics

### **Step 2: Prompt Engineering**
The analysis is used to create a detailed prompt:
```
PERSON DETAILS: [Gemini's analysis]
OUTFIT TO WEAR: [Selected clothing item]
REQUIREMENTS:
- Maintain same person characteristics
- Keep similar pose
- Professional fashion photography lighting
- Clean background
- Ultra-realistic quality
```

### **Step 3: Image Generation** (Imagen 3 "Nano Banana")
Imagen 3 generates a photorealistic preview:
- ✅ Aspect ratio: 3:4 (perfect for fashion)
- ✅ Person generation: Allowed
- ✅ Safety filters: Block only high
- ✅ Output: Base64 encoded PNG
